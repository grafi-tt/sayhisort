# SayhiSort

Block merge sort implementation inspired by [GrailSort](https://github.com/Mrrl/GrailSort). Pronunciation of “say hi” sounds like 「聖杯（せいはい）」 in Japanese, which means “grail”.

TODO: complete sort routine. Most subroutines are already unittested.

Remaining tasks are

* refactor merge level management to a struct
* test and fix it
* test and fix MergeOneLevel
* test and fix the toplevel Sort routine

TODO: doc

TODO: benchmark
